# 🧪 First ML Project

This is my first project related to Machine Learning. In it, I explored multiple data-cleaning techniques and trained various models to evaluate their performance.

A comparison was made between several machine learning models, ranging from the simplest to more advanced algorithms. The models evaluated include:

- `DummyClassifier`
- `Logistic Regression`
- `Decision Tree Classifier`
- `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`
- `Random Forest`
- `Gradient Boosting Classifier`
- `LightGBM Classifier`

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to achieve the highest possible **AUC** score using a dataset containing medical records of diabetes patients, with 20 clinical features per sample.  
You can find the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/34/diabetes).

## 📌 Key Highlights

- Applied multiple preprocessing and data-cleaning techniques.
- Trained and evaluated various models using cross-validation.
- Compared model performance based on AUC scores.
- Implemented techniques to address **overfitting**.
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- Used **LIME** for model interpretability and feature impact analysis.
- Validated model generalization through cross-validation.
